# The ASP.NET Core Workshop

In January 2018, the live stream hit a total of 500 followers, and met the initial follower goal Jeff set.  In return for meeting this goal, an ASP.NET Core 2.0 workshop was scheduled and would be hosted for approximately 8 hours on February 16, 2018 starting at 10am ET / 15:00 UTC

## Questions

*  __Is there a cost to attend the workshop?__
   *  Nope!  Completely free... tune in whenever you would like on [Twitch](twitch.tv/csharpfritz) or [Mixer](mixer.com/csharpfritz)

*  __Do I need to buy Jeff's book to follow along?__
   *  Nope!  No external materials are needed.  

*  __Can my colleagues tune in?  Is there a limit to the number of viewers?__
   *  Bring all of your friends!  It would be better if they each logged in to Twitch or Mixer individually, so that they can ask questions during the workshop

*  __What content are you covering?__
   *  We will build a complete application using ASP.NET Core for tracking travel information.

*  __Is this just Jeff presenting, or will there be guests during the workshop?__
   *  There will be guests!  I've recruited a handful of .NET experts to help during the day:
      * Shayne Boyer
      * Julie Lerman
      * Jon Galloway
      * _maybe one or two more_

* __I can't watch all day, will I be able to watch the VOD or recording on YouTube?__
   *  I'm not sure about this one yet... I'd like the content to be available, but it is going to be a LOT of video.

* __Are the samples available online?__
   *  The sample code will all be available, and will be published on the day of the workshop
