# The C-Sharp Workshop

In April 2018, I wanted to take the next steps in evolving our live coding sessions and do something a little more than just write code on video.  It's time to start making learning about technology in a classroom setting accessible to everyone, everywhere.

This is the first of a series of workshops that I am writing and will be presenting with groups of technologists.  I promise you dear reader, every one of these will be completely free to watch, download, access the samples of, and participate in when they are published live.  I plan to deliver a full workshop every other month to start, on a new topic each month.

This workshop is tentatively scheduled for 8 hours starting on May 18, 2018 at 10am ET / 7am PT / 14:00 UTC / 8pm IST.

## Questions about the Workshop

*  __Is there a cost to attend the workshop?__
   *  Nope!  Completely free... tune in whenever you would like on [Twitch](twitch.tv/csharpfritz)

*  __Can my colleagues tune in?  Is there a limit to the number of viewers?__
   *  Bring all of your friends!  It would be better if they each logged in to Twitch  individually, so that they can ask questions during the workshop

*  __What content are you covering?__
   *  We will review a series of designed examples using C# and .NET Core to demonstrate all of the various features of the C# language.  Additionally, we will learn how to use Git source control, good application design patterns, and the latest memory management features of .NET Core

*  __Is this just Jeff presenting, or will there be guests during the workshop?__
   *  There will be guests!  I've recruited a handful of .NET experts to help during the day:
      * Bill Wagner
      * Sara Ford
      * Mads Torgersen
      * Steve Smith
      * Sarah Dutkiewicz
      * Phil Japikse
      * Immo Landwerth

* __I can't watch all day, will I be able to watch the VOD or recording on YouTube?__
   *  You betcha!  The content will be available for roughly 60 days on Twitch, and we will place videos on YouTube.  

* __What should I have installed in order to follow along with the workshop?__
   *  You should install the .NET SDK from https://dot.net/core and it's not required, but we recommend a Visual Studio with .NET Core features enabled:
      *  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Free and open source for Mac, Linux, and Windows
      *  [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.com) - Community is free for hobbyists, students, and startups (with limitations).
      *  [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.com) - Community is free for hobbyists, students, and startups (with limitations).
