## Guests

I enjoy having guests join me for some pair-programming, because we're always going to learn something new together.  More information
about my scheduled guests can how you can join me as a guest on the stream can be found on the [guests page](Guests.md).

## Jeff's Setup

Jeff has written about how he has the hardware configured as well as the software to produce stream [on his blog](http://jeffreyfritz.com/2017/12/live-streaming-101-my-setup/).  
*  Jeff uses [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) to make the Powershell prompt easier to navigate while working with Git repositories
