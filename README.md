When questions are answered, they are closed and links are added to the wrap-up blog post for the stream they were answered in.

## Current Projects

Jeff has been working on the following projects on stream:

* [Fritz.StreamTools](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.StreamTools) - (Formerly called RunDown) An ASP.NET Core project that will manage show information for streamers and provide easy browser-based plugins for your video content.
* [CoreWiki](https://github.com/csharpfritz/CoreWiki) - An ASP.NET Core based content management system that has been built from scratch as a learner's project on stream.

## Former Projects

* [Fritz.ConfigurationBuilders](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.ConfigurationBuilders) - A collection of ConfigurationBuilders for .NET 4.7.1 and later that support loading application configuration from other sources include INI, YML, and RSS
* [Fritz.EpicBuildMusic](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Fritz.EpicBuildMusic) - A Visual Studio extension that is designed to make working in Visual Studio a little more fun.

## Guests

I enjoy having guests join me for some pair-programming, because we're always going to learn something new together.  More information
about my scheduled guests can how you can join me as a guest on the stream can be found on the [guests page](Guests.md).

## Jeff's Setup

Jeff has written about how he has the hardware configured as well as the software to produce stream [on his blog](http://jeffreyfritz.com/2017/12/live-streaming-101-my-setup/).  
*  Jeff uses [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) to make the Powershell prompt easier to navigate while working with Git repositories 
*  When coding with a guest, Jeff and the guest use [Visual Studio Live Share](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/blob/master/README.md) to work on code on screen at the same time.
*  Jeff uses a bunch of great Visual Studio extensions, and you can find that list on the [WebTools repository](https://github.com/csharpfritz/Ignite2017-WebTools).
